            Sleep is an essential function that allows your body and mind to
            recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. Healthy
            sleep also helps the body remain healthy and stave off diseases.
            Without enough sleep, the brain cannot function properly. This can
            impair your abilities to concentrate, think clearly, and process
            memories.

            Most adults require between seven and nine hours of nightly sleep.
            Children and teenagers need substantially more sleep, particularly
            if they are younger than five years of age. Work schedules,
            day-to-day stressors, a disruptive bedroom environment, and medical
            conditions can all prevent us from receiving enough sleep. A healthy
            diet and positive lifestyle habits can help ensure an adequate
            amount of sleep each night â€“ but for some, chronic lack of sleep may
            be the first sign of a sleep disorder.
